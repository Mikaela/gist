! Block third party fonts. Once I experience breakage, I will switch to the
! second rule after which more breakage reports I will keep both commented.
! However personally I am unlikely to see this as I keep changing font through
! Dark Reader and OpenDyslexic extensions anyway...
*$font

! In case of issues add a custom filter `*$font,badfilter`

! This suggests disabling only third party fonts
! https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Per-site-switches#no-remote-fonts
! NOTE that this doesn't seem to affect LocalCDN (which would mind first party
! fonts being blocked though as it only cares about CDNs)
!*$font,third-party

! The above suggests `*$font,third-party,badfilter` possibly would override
! this in custom rules.
