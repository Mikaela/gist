# Briar notes

Briar is a P2P over Tor messenger that can also peer over LAN and Bluetooth.

`my-accounts.csv` has list of my Briar addresses, as there isn't support
for multiple devices. They possibly should be in aminda.eu, but I don't
know what would be a good way to show them as browser integrated CSV
viewers are rare and I don't think these would be in so much demand.

Briar doesn't hold as big place in my heart as IRC or Matrix to have a
dedicated page either and my HTML table tendency is effort even if the page
wasn't given a navigation menu entry.

## Naming

I tend to name my accounts `Aminda-HOSTNAME (%Y-%j)` e.g.
`Aminda-Lumina (2022-153)` where `%Y` is year in 4 digits and `%j` the day
of the year (001 to 366). However the older the Briar account still in use,
the more random naming scheme there is.

This is by no means a security feature, anyone can name their device like
that, it's more of convenience should there be older and newer me on same
device in contacts lists. This doesn't either mean that I will remember
this scheme or updating these files.

## Briar desktop

* TODO: what ports does it want opened in firewall for LAN peering?

I install it from Flathub and at the time of writing it doesn't support
groups (where only creator can add users), forums (groups where everyone can
add new users) or blogs.
