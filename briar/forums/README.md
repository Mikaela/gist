# Lists of Briar forums

Briar Forums are groups where anyone can add anyone. They have no further
moderation options than people cutting contact with abusive users.

- `PandaCoderPL` introduced many to Briar forums and messages from them are
  visible in many forums especially those they list. To avoid duplication,
  I have included their repository as a submodule.
- `started-by-me.csv` has those I created, but due to the way how Briar
  works I have no special access/power over others there.
  - This is intentionally missing forums that contain just me and another
    person with multiple devices as Briar doesn't have multidevice support
    and groups being untransferrable is too painful to use them, although
    it carries risk of someone accidentally oversharing forums and thus
    revealing past messages. A dead friend forum where everyone else may
    have stopped using Briar is also omitted.
  - I mostly have `date +%Y-%j` in the end of forums I create so in case
    someone else has the same idea, there is unlikely to be two forums with
    the exact same name (which is possible and not a problem for Briar).

I am on many forums and open to forum shares although I have been rejecting
languages I consider more excotic for me. I don't understand everything going
on them or should look into some subjects more deeply in order to decide am
I comfortable sharing some.
