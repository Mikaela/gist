# Potentially useful progressive web apps

PWAs are especially useful for iOS users, since PWAs added to homescreen
from Safari are able to request notifications permission resulting
nativeish experience outside of App Store without even having to
install anything.

Method for distinguishing PWAs from normal websites: adding them to
iOS homescreen and seeing which open as "their own apps" _or_ having
Chromium suggest "installing" them without manually "installing" them.

Proper identification: `view-source` (`CTRL - U`) and `CTRL - F` for
`manifest` e.g. `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">` in `<head>`.

- https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Manifest

It looks like `about:apps` on Edge (or all Chromiums?) has a
`Show applications menu on toolbar` button which then when pressed on a tab
has more details for PWAs. "App whatever is available" with logo and "Publisher:"
fields.

**_TODO: Some of these may be miscategorized while not fullfilling the criteria of PWA._**
