# Potentially useful progressive web apps

Method for distinguishing PWAs from normal websites: adding them to
iOS homescreen and seeing which open as "their own apps" *or* having
Chromium suggest "installing" them without manually "installing" them.

## Events

* Mobilizon - all instances of the federated event & group site function as
  PWAs.

## Food

* https://menu.unicafe.fi/ - menu for UniCafes

## Instant messaging

* https://fluffychat.im/web/ - Matrix client
* https://glowing-bear.org/ - WeeChat Relay (protocol) client

## Music

* https://music.youtube.com/ - YouTube Music (Player)

## Travel

* https://guide.suomenlinna.fi/ - mobile guide for Suomenlinna (UNESCO World Heritage site),
  which is also a neighbourhood in Helsinki, Finland.

## Not PWAs but still possibly useful for homescreens

Continuing the previous method, these open in Safari.
