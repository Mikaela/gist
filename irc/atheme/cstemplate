#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script generates commands which can be copy-pasted to Atheme's
# ChanServ to set templates which can later be set with flags.

# With these templates, bots and ops are opped and (trusted) users are
# voiced. I am not fully sure where I took the word "users", but it's good
# enough.

## ChanServ settings
# Tell ChanServ to be on channel. Not needed for larger channels
echo "/cs set $1 GUARD ON"

# Disables ChanServ MLOCK
echo "/cs set $1 MLOCK"

# Hide channel information from people who don't have +A
echo "/cs set $1 PRIVATE ON"

# Sync flags when they are changed
echo "/cs set $1 NOSYNC OFF"

# Allow only identified users to be opped
echo "/cs set $1 SECURE ON"

# Allow only users with +t flag to change topic
echo "/cs set $1 TOPICLOCK ON"

# Allows everyone to see ACL changes.
echo "/cs set $1 VERBOSE ON"

## ChanServ templates
# Channel founder who can do anything they want.
echo "/cs template $1 founder !+*F"

# Successor will get all flags in the end and if they cannot be trusted
# with them now, they really shouldn't be successor.
echo "/cs template $1 successor !+*S"

# Super op, be able to do everything with services
echo "/cs template $1 sop !-aq+*"

# Normal op, be able to invite, invite, kick, kickban, unban, change topic
echo "/cs template $1 op !+*-Rfaqs"

# Half op, be able to do everything else than kick other halfops & higher
echo "/cs template $1 hop !+vVhHirtAe-asq"

# Network operator whom we want to have a little access so they can help
# with channel issues in case our own ops are away.
# Usually given to $OPER or staffer hostmask.
echo "/cs template $1 oper !+*-RfOVaqs"

# User who is just allowed to voice themselves and get into the channel
# unless they are banned.
echo "/cs template $1 user !+ViA"

# Permanent ban. Removes all flags and sets autokick.
echo "/cs template $1 ban !-*+b"
