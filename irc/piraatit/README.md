Bot config files or samples or examples that have something to do with me
and Pirate Party Finland (Piraattipuolue). I am not sure if they can be
used directly to start bots, at least Limnoria configs require creating
other directories around them and
`supybot-adduser -u root -p password -c owner conf/users.conf`.

I won't promise to keep this up-to-date, but I think it might be better
than nothing.
