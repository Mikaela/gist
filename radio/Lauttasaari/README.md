In this directory I aim to document radio related things I have noted at
Lauttasaari.

FM-bookmarks.csv lists what presets I have in my FM Radio so
I will hopefully find them again if I mess up or I have something where I
can check what the presets are when I forget them.

There is also MW-DX-log.csv where I will attempt to document what
I end up [DXing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXing) using the same radio,
but from MW frequencies and when. I imagine it will become better formatted
by time or move into a better place than this repository/directory if I will
keep up the hobby.

My current listener is Philips AZ 1407 from 1999 which I didn't previously
know to be capable of catching foreign stations.
