This repository is a random assortment of files. In the beginning, I had
some of them at gist.github.com, but as it doesn't provide any way for me
to sort files, a separate repository is easier to handle.

I have since moved the repository from GitHub due to concerns related to
their relationship with the
[ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice) and
[Iran](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us).
