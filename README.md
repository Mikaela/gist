This repository is a random assortment of files. In the beginning, I had
some of them at gist.github.com, but as it doesn't provide any way for me
to sort files, a separate repository is easier to handle.

I have since moved the repository from GitHub due to concerns related to
their relationship with the
[ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice) and
[Iran](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us).

# LICENSING

`3ea1645f746abf8de4683aadf07202bce38480f5` (_Tue Feb 21 14:15:46 2023 +0200_) switches from BSD-3 clause to
CC0. I don't think anything here qualifies as original work or licensable
in general.

However I am always happy to hear if I have inspired something so if you
have some method of attribution, I am happy to be included, while that is
by no means necessary.
