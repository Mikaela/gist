Matrix Spaces being beta don't currently have much discovery options and
aren't supported on iOS at all, so this file has a couple of Spaces I like
so I can either refer people here or copy them by hand. This list is going
to be biased and I hope there will be a dedicated space directory or some
formal method of finding them later in development.

* The *Apothecery* https://matrix.to/#/!zYPetrOdqxxQYoWCTb:the-apothecary.club?via=the-apothecary.club&via=matrix.org&via=feneas.org
  * I just love the atmosphere of the community and the moderators are doing
    a great job keeping it safe and friendly
* https://matrix.to/#/!FlVUGgSwRvZMIkXPLd:artemislena.eu?via=artemislena.eu&via=feneas.org&via=the-apothecary.club
  * Artemislena.eu or *Fantasycookie* are just some of the people I am copying with my space and room
    (another being [Sheo's random talks](https://shivering-isles.com/matrix)
    where there is no space yet to my knowledge), good ideas just are made to be copied ;)
* https://matrix.to/#/!TznXPHLOGAYStwBeWZ:feneas.org?via=feneas.org&via=matrix.org&via=federator.dev
  * *Feneas*, Federated networks association works to promote federated networks, I have
    recently activated there with IRC management and am a committee member.
* https://matrix.to/#/!iMZEhwCvbfeAYUxAjZ:t2l.io?via=matrix.org&via=fairydust.space&via=beeper.com
  * *Matrix Community*, anything Matrix related
* https://matrix.to/#/!WDaMZSVinTZRLOTajM:hacklab.fi?via=hacklab.fi&via=kapsi.fi&via=matrix.org
  * *Matrix Suomi*, a lot of Finnish rooms on Matrix, including subspaces
    * https://matrix.to/#/!JeBPVWimhOlluKSPSO:feneas.org?via=feneas.org&via=matrix.org&via=pirateriot.net
    * Pirate Party Finland, where I am IM manager + ICT team member
* https://matrix.to/#/!qSofmIvsivYgvSWZej:maunium.net?via=maunium.net&via=matrix.org&via=feneas.org
  * *Maunium*, a lot of Mautrix things including, but not limited to, bridges and bots (especially maubot)
    for both usefulness and enterainment
* https://matrix.to/#/!svrCeIqXkGxedfDFVT:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=scamdemic.wtf&via=feneas.org
  * Wireless *Mesh* Networks, I haven't been so active with them, but I love
    the idea of them and happened to notice the link while typing this
* https://matrix.to/#/!psumPMeAfzgAeQpXMG:feneas.org?via=matrix.org&via=feneas.org&via=the-apothecary.club
  * *Mikaela.info*, my own space, it may not yet host interesting or random
    discussions that much, but sometimes I find it motivating to see that
    I am doing things when I see git forge/commit activity.
* https://matrix.to/#/!XvLsfIFskBFvyfBuel:pixie.town?via=privacytools.io&via=feneas.org&via=matrix.org
  * *PrivacyTools.io*, encryption against mass surveillance. I am not entirely
    sure about the officialness of this space
