## Proof of Concept curated list of spaces as opposed to room directory

Earlier on 2024-02-29 I called Matrix room directory as a mistake that sholdn't have been implemented and offered curated spaces or room lists as a solution instead.

I used to have one in this location, but it was kind of bitrotted and unmaintained, so I removed it until now restoring it greater than before.

Of course this file makes me the curator/authority of room listing and thus I challenge you, the reader, to make your own space or version of this file, maybe I can even link to your list here? :smiley_cat:

_Room IDs should be included so advanced users can use them in case of alias server downtime, but that would be effort and this proof of concept is yet untested._

## Spaces around a single individual

- [`#eu.aminda.space.10:pikaviestin.fi`](matrix:r/eu.aminda.space.10:pikaviestin.fi?action=join) is my own space, it may not yet host interesting or random discussions that much, but sometimes I find it motivating to see that I am doing things when I see git forge/commit activity. `!fGtopoZuCySnTsSdsU:matrix.org` (v10)

## Matrix protocol

- [`#community:matrix.org`](matrix:r/community:matrix.org?action=join) is your space for anything Matrix related, whether a homeserver, client, bot, anything. And as you are hearing of it now from my listing, I can highlight my favourites:
  - [`#fluffy-space:matrix.org`](matrix:r/fluffy-space:matrix.org?action=join) the fluffiest and cutest Matrix client you will find
  - [`#community:nheko.im`](matrix:r/community:nheko.im?action=join) is the
    most featured cross-platform desktop client I know of

## Technology

- [`#ftechspace:matrix.org`](matrix:r/ftechspace:matrix.org?action=join) furries and technology allowing non-tech subjects too and sign of furries on your platform is sign of your platform being alive! `!NHApwMwsFHfFrRMfrD:jae.fi` v6)

## Finnish

- [`#matrix-suomi:kapsi.fi`](matrix:r/matrix-suomi:kapsi.fi?action=join) is a curated listing of Finnish language rooms about all subjects. `!WDaMZSVinTZRLOTajM:hacklab.fi` (v6)

## Rooms

_These are actually rooms instead of spaces, but I want to include them regardless for whatever reason._

### People

My spaces actually exist on Matrix inspired by these people, otherwise I might only be at XMPP and IRC.
